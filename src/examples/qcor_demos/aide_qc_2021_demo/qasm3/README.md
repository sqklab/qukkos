# QASM3 Integration

The goal here is to show that this is an integration platform, and

# Goals
* Show QPE example from qukkos to note how one can do this at various language levels
* Show the QASM3 example, walk through it, and compile and run
* Show the lowering to MLIR, then to LLVM IR
* Note that this could be an efficient means for large scale circuit sim
* Demo that
