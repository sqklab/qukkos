# QUKKOS FTQC Runtime

## Test cases: Iterative QPE and QEC circuits

## Goals

- Demonstrating tighly-coupled FTQC execution model of QUKKOS (same XACC IR, different runtime model).

## Outline

- CLI option to configure runtime mode.

- Iterative QPE (using only 1 couting qubit for arbitrary precision). Multiple runs with console logging to demonstrate conditional phase corrections.

- 3-qubit bit-flip error correction code: error decoding and correction with conditional statements.
