// in this case EstimateRealOverlapBetweenStates from the Standard Library (Hadamard test)
// https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumLibraries/blob/main/Standard/src/Characterization/Distinguishability.qs
// Driver to tie them all together:
// - Declare the exported QASM3 callable 
// - Use that as input to the Q# operation

// Compile with:
// qukkos -qrt ftqc overlap_calc.qs kernel.qasm driver.cpp

// Note: this driver can be part of QASM3 as well, but
// we don't have the concept of Callable type in QASM3 yet,
// hence, we cannot declare the Q# kernel taking Callable argumements as extern
// in QASM3 yet.
