QUKKOS is a single-source C++, retargetable quantum-classical compiler enabling 
low and high level quantum programming, compilation, and execution. QUKKOS represents the integration 
of the XACC quantum framework with the ubiquitous Clang/LLVM classical compiler frameworks. The QUKKOS 
compiler extends both of these infrastructures via simple plugin extensions, and enables programmers 
to express quantum kernel expressions (functors containing quantum code) alongside standard 
C++.
